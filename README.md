# PROJECT TWO

## Disclaimer

I am way behind. I need to understand APIs a little better to be able to plan my project.

I have been working this morning on a concept that I believe will have a solid foundation that will be obtainable, while keeping a stretch goal list that can make the app something I am actually proud of. I was hoping to have it done before the css lecture. Since I didn't make that goal, I will be extremely brief and explain the concept for now.

MVP goals: A discussion forum for poker players to submit hands they have played and a comment section for advice/analysis. 

STRETCH goals: The real idea I have been trying to formulate, with minimal success, is a poker tournament organization tool. This will require a form for setting up a tournament, with a countdown clock, a player tracker, and a blinds calculator. 

Update: again I think I have underestimated the complexity of my idea. I am going to ease up a bit and limit my stretch goals to adding a comment and leave my mvp without user comments.

POKER API: https://www.pokerapi.dev/
-current api remains untested.
